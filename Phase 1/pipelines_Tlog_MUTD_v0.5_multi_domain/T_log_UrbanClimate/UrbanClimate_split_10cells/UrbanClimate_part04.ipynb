    "- Stabilité par fenêtre : pour les fenêtres 3‑ans la **consistence du signe** est très haute (≈ 97.65% pour A/B/C)；pour les fenêtres annuelles elle est plus faible mais élevée (A/C ≈ 88.9%, B ≈ 93.3%)【temporal_cv_3yr_stability.csv】【temporal_cv_annual_stability.csv】.  \n",
    "- Comportement temporel observé : T_log fluctue dans le temps, avec épisodes isolés où la médiane de la fenêtre s’approche ou dépasse 0 (ex. années autour de 1984, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2014 selon heatmaps), mais ces épisodes sont rares et documentés dans les CSV produits【temporal_cv_3yr.csv】【temporal_cv_annual.csv】.  \n",
    "- Conclusion pratique : la preuve empirique que T_log < 0 est cohérente et répétable sous les pipelines transparents (A, B, C). La conclusion reste sensible à choix méthodologiques et à certaines périodes historiques — transparence et publication des diagnostics sont donc indispensables.\n",
