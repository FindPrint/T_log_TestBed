ABSTRACT:
This document introduces the T_log parameter, a heuristic measure designed to classify the dynamics of complex systems. Inspired by the notion of critical dimension in statistical physics, T_log evaluates whether a system tends toward saturation (stability), criticality (transition), or divergence (instability) as a function of its size (n) and its effective dimension (d). Its simple formulation makes it possible to characterize the state of a system and anticipate its evolution, with potential applications ranging from social networks to cosmology.

1. INTRODUCTION

The analysis of complex systems requires indicators capable of characterizing their dynamic state. Real systems rarely evolve in a purely linear way; they typically move through distinct regimes of stability, rapid transition, or chaotic growth.

The T_log parameter is proposed as a simple tool to identify these regimes based on two fundamental properties: the size of the system and its dimensional structure.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION

The tension parameter is defined as:

    T_log(n, d) = (d - 4) * log(n)

where:
- n: The size of the system. It represents the number of elements, interactions, or data points (e.g., number of nodes in a graph, sample size).
- d: The effective dimension of the system. It measures structural complexity or how elements are connected (e.g., spectral dimension of a network, Hausdorff dimension of a time process).
- 4: The reference critical dimension, inspired by field theory in physics, where d = 4 often separates qualitatively different behaviors.
- log(n): The natural logarithm, acting as an amplification factor that reflects scale effects.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. INTERPRETATION OF REGIMES

The sign of T_log classifies the system into one of three dynamic regimes:

- T_log > 0 (when d > 4): Saturation Regime (Stability)
  - Interpretation: The system is constrained by its high dimensionality. Interactions are mostly local and growth is limited.
  - Expected behavior: Tendency toward stabilization, formation of stable clusters, damping of perturbations.

- T_log ≈ 0 (when d ≈ 4): Critical Regime
  - Interpretation: The system is at a fragile equilibrium, a "phase transition" point. It is extremely sensitive to small perturbations.
  - Expected behavior: Large fluctuations, high sensitivity to initial conditions, potential for abrupt regime changes.

- T_log < 0 (when d < 4): Divergent Regime (Instability)
  - Interpretation: The system is weakly constrained. Long-range interactions may dominate, leading to rapid or chaotic growth.
  - Expected behavior: Explosive growth, structural instability, fast propagation of information or perturbations.

4. QUALITATIVE TABLE

The following table summarizes the qualitative behavior:

| Value of T_log | Dynamic Regime | Qualitative Description                                                 | Analogy                                                     |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| T_log > 0      | Saturation     | The system is "too dense" to change radically. It converges.           | A dense forest where a fire struggles to propagate.         |
| T_log ≈ 0      | Criticality    | The system is "just right", on the edge of change.                    | A sand pile where the next grain can trigger an avalanche.  |
| T_log < 0      | Divergence     | The system is "too sparse" and can explode in many directions.        | A rumor on a highly connected social network.               |

------------------------------------------------------------
5. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS

T_log can be used as a macroscopic indicator in various domains:

- Social networks: Assess whether a network is in a phase of explosive growth (d < 4) or stabilizing into communities (d > 4).
- Economics: Detect whether a market is in a critical state (d ≈ 4), potentially indicating an upcoming bubble or crash.
- Biology: Model transitions between controlled growth and uncontrolled proliferation (e.g., cancer), where a regime change corresponds to a change in d.
- Cosmology: Analyze "tension" in large-scale surveys as a function of sample size (n).

In each application, the main challenge is to define and measure the effective dimension d in a robust and meaningful way.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS

Advantages:
- Simplicity: Easy to compute once n and d are known.
- Generality: Conceptually independent of the specific nature of the system.
- Interpretive power: Provides an immediate qualitative classification of dynamics via the sign of T_log.

Limitations:
- Heuristic nature: The formula is not derived from first principles for all domains; it is a physics-inspired model.
- Dependence on d: The usefulness of the parameter depends entirely on a robust definition and measurement of the effective dimension d.
- Universality to be tested: The relevance of the reference value d = 4 must be validated empirically in each domain.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. CONCLUSION

The T_log parameter is proposed as a powerful heuristic tool for the analysis of complex systems. By linking the size (n) and structural dimension (d) of a system, it offers a unified framework to identify regimes of saturation, criticality, and divergence. Although its universality still requires extensive empirical validation, it constitutes a promising starting point for analyzing and anticipating structural transitions in a wide variety of contexts.
